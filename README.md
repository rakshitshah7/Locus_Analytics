Relationship of Companies in Seattle's Aerospace Industry
### Thought Process
I started with scanning the data and applied different combination of columns to make the best sense of the data at first. Then I looked at each combination and figured which way a report given to a customer would make him happy. 
I felt that representing this data in a graph would make sense and would give customer a better idea of how data is related to each other. At first, creating a graph made it more complex. As there were many companies and the view less. So I created a view for single company using a simple dropdown and then representated all the companies associated with it.  
#### Output of one of the selected company ["Commercial Airlines"]

This graph gives us a perfect view of companies associated with the select company with a well defined direction and it also gives the Activities & Object associated with each company.
